<meta name="description" content="This book is a guidebook for medical data management in R.">

<meta http-equiv="Content-Type" content="text/html; charset=utf-8">

Welcome to `dmur`!

This is a book for anyone who are interested in manipulating and processing medical data. This book introduces different aspects of data management and how to implement these in R using RStudio. While there are a plethora of great R books covering a variety of data management topics, I hope this book would serve as a self-learning guide to avoid roadblocks and frustrations before becoming fully comfortable with using R. Many beginners find themselves wanting to develop data management skills in R, but lose their patience after they encounter a steep learning curve of R and several months of frustration. If you feel nostalgic about this, this book is for you. 

It is intended for non-technical audience and Stata users to: 

* Serve as a guidebook to R code for data management
* Serve as a R code reference manual for `mStats` package
* Provide task-centered examples addressing common data management problems
* Assist people in transitioning to R
